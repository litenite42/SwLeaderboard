                        BUUuuuttt for those that may not....
                        SkillWarz is a free-to-play (atm) FPS written in Unity by a single developer, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/OneManArmy3D">OneManArmy</a>. </p>

                    <summary>What's this site?</summary>
                    <p>Well like the long-winded title says, it's dedicated to the <strong>Unofficial</strong> Discord bot for SkillWarz (see above).
                        The bots reads from the leaderboard on the game's forum to provide a quick way to access player information available there.
                        This means that it can easily page (forwards/backwards) through the top 200 players or you can look for data about a specific user.
                        Because it depends on the same (or close enough) requests as the scoreboard, the bot has the same limitations; namely: no extra fields 
                        can be retrieved, player search is case-sensitive, and such.
